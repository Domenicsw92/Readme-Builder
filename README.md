# Readme-Builder
This Readme builder is an application built for users which are having issues developing a quality ReadMe document for their Repo or application. This application was built using JavaScript and Node.JS. This application can be cloned to a users local storage to build and generate ReadMe documents when needed. Once cloned or forked a user will develop a quality ReadMe through the index.js and opening an integrated terminal in their code builder. By running commands  (npm i) in terminal , run command (node  index.js), this command will prompt the program to run and begin the questionnaire to build a quality ReadME for the user. The generated build me will have a Table of contents, links to the users GitHub and Email, as well the ReadME will have options for licenses and to place a URL for the users deployed site.
